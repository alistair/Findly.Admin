@model Findly.Admin.HomeModel

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<pre>
* The FubuRegistry class is AdminFubuRegistry.  Use this class to register custom policies or
  configure FubuMVC application settings




* StructureMap configuration is in the file AdminRegistry
* StructureMap's default 'IFoo is Foo' conventions are configured for this project

The FubuMVC application is defined in the AdminApplication class.  It's unlikely that you'll
need to customize the application bootstrapping, but AdminApplication is where that would
happen.  You will want to refer to this class later if you use multiple forms of hosting (ASP.Net, 
Katana, or Serenity).


* The home page is served by HomeEndpoint.Index()
* HomeEndpoint.Index() could be eliminated if you choose
  to use Home.cshtml as an 'actionless view'
* Shared/Application.cshtml is the master layout for the application
